Shelder is a pet speed-dating application. The app finds homes for abandoned darlings using a modern "dating app" design.

This app use:
 - Beautiful Soup library to web scrape data from the "Lābas Mājas" shelter located at Riga, Latvia
 - wxPython as a GUI framework
      
Note:
- wxPython is an awful decision: not only because of the fact that the idea and format requires a web-app, it's an old and badly documented Python framework
- Maybe a second app version is coming soon.
