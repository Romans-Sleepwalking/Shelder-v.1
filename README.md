The Owner-to-Pet speed-dating application with Tinder-like visual desing. The author was concerned about the amount of sheltered animals in Riga, Latvia. Therefore, he created the app that inspires potential care-givers to consider adopting sheltered animals rather than purchasing via sequential logic and modern gamificated design. The pet database loads at the first step of program execution - data corresponds to the local shelter in Riga (link-supported). 

This app use:
 - Python as programming language because it was cheap.
 - Beautiful Soup (Python) library to web scrape data from the "Lābas Mājas" shelter located in Riga, Latvia.
 - wxPython library as a Windows GUI framework. That was an awful decision because it is extremely user unfriendly. The format requires browser UI.
